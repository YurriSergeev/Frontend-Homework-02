				<div class="paragraph"; align="justify">Bjarne Stroustrup is a Danish computer scientist, most notable for the creation and development of the widely used C++ programming language. He is a visiting professor at Columbia University, and works at Morgan Stanley as a Managing Director in New York.</div>
				<div class="yelp"><h4 align="center">Education</h4></div> 
				<div class="paragraph"; align="justify">Stroustrup has a master's degree in mathematics and computer science (1975) from Aarhus University, Denmark, and a PhD. in computer science (1979) from the University of Cambridge, England. His thesis advisor at Cambridge was Professor David Wheeler.</div>
				<div class="yelp"><h4 align="center">Career</h4></div> 
				<div class="paragraph"; align="justify">Stroustrup began developing C++ in 1979 (then called C with Classes), and, in his own words, invented C++, wrote its early definitions, and produced its first implementation... chose and formulated the design criteria for C++, designed all its major facilities, and was responsible for the processing of extension proposals in the C++ standards committee.

From 2002 to 2014, Stroustrup was the College of Engineering Chair in Computer Science Professor at Texas A&M University. As of January 2014, Stroustrup is a Managing Director in the technology division of Morgan Stanley in New York City and a Visiting Professor in Computer Science at Columbia University. ITMO University noble doctor since 2013. In 2015, he was made a Fellow of the Computer History Museum for his invention of the C++ programming language.. In 2017, the IET announced that he is the Faraday Medal recipient, for pioneering C++, one of the most influential programming language in the history of computing.</div>
